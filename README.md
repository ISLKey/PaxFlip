• Standard structure - Follows Flipper Zero specifications

🔧 Troubleshooting

Common Issues

File Won't Save
• Check permissions - Ensure write access to chosen location
• Valid filename - Avoid special characters in token names
• Disk space - Ensure sufficient space (files are very small)

Flipper Zero Won't Read File
• Check file extension - Must be .rfid
• Verify content - Use preview feature to check format
• SD card format - Ensure SD card is properly formatted
• File location - Place in accessible location on SD card

Wrong Key Type
• EM4100 vs HIDProx - Tool uses EM4100 for Paxton tokens
• Reader compatibility - Ensure target reader supports EM4100
• Protocol verification - Confirm token type with original article
